# The official atuin setup script UNCONDITIONALLY appends `eval "$(atuin init …)"`
# to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bashrc (creating ~/.zshrc if absent) — there is no opt-out
# flag (--non-interactive only gates the import/login prompts; it still edits the
# rc files). mesh OWNS both rc files: the zsh bundle deploys them carrying the
# "managed by mesh-workstation" marker and already provides atuin's PATH + init
# via its own .zshrc.d/.bashrc.d `20-terminal-ux` fragment (with the nicer
# --disable-up-arrow). atuin's append is therefore redundant AND harmful — it
# leaves an unmarked ~/.zshrc and dirties the /etc/skel-identical ~/.bashrc, both
# of which the deploy overwrite-guard then refuses, silently blocking the
# canonical rc deploy on every fresh machine (this is what failed the CI smoke
# test once the rust-bins hang ahead of it was removed).
#
# So snapshot the two rc files immediately before the installer runs and restore
# them exactly afterwards: a file that existed is byte-restored (dropping atuin's
# append); a file atuin created from nothing is removed. The atuin binary
# (~/.atuin/bin), its env shim, and ~/.bash-preexec.sh (which mesh's bash fragment
# sources) are untouched — only the unsolicited rc edits are reverted.
