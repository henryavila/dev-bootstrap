# Custom installer: delegates to the existing 178-LOC interactive
# scripts/setup-identity.sh (gh auth + SSH key + GitHub registration).
# Wrapper avoids rewriting the procedural script during mass migration.

# Identity setup needs either a non-interactive GitHub PAT (GITHUB_TOKEN) or a
# usable /dev/tty for the interactive `gh auth login`. With NEITHER — e.g. a
# piped `setup.sh --non-interactive` and no token — scripts/setup-identity.sh
# exits 1, which the engine's fail-fast turns into a WHOLE-RUN abort, taking
# down every later bundle for an item that cannot run headless. Treat that
# non-runnable case as a clean SKIP so the rest of the bootstrap proceeds;
# identity is deferred to a later interactive `mesh setup` (or a run that sets
# GITHUB_TOKEN). Mirrors the gpg-signing skip (4252d81): "cannot act here" is
# not a failure. check() keeps its honest meaning; install()/verify() tolerate
# the skip so a non-runnable headless run neither aborts nor false-succeeds.
