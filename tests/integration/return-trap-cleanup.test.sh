# Guards a whole class of bug: a `trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' RETURN` set inside a
# HELPER function LEAKS — the RETURN trap stays armed after that helper returns
# and fires AGAIN when the caller (or any later function) returns, at which point
# the helper's local `$tmp` is out of scope. Under the engine's `set -u` that
# aborts with "tmp: unbound variable" — which is exactly what killed the bootstrap
# at mysql/mysql-wsl once the rust-bins hang ahead of it was removed. The fix is a
# self-clearing trap: `trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"; trap - RETURN' RETURN`.
#
# Part A reproduces the failure + proves the fix behaviourally (pure bash, no
# network/sudo). Part B asserts every known leak-prone site adopted the disarm.
